# Stroke_prediction
This dataset is taken from the UC Irvine machine learning repository. This dataset has 5111 rows and 10 variables. Variables include.
Gender: It is a categorical variable. It has males, females, and others.
Age: It is a numerical variable. It describes the age of a patient. It ranges from 1 to 82, and it contains a few errors with decimals that need to be imputed with the mean.
Hypertension: It represents whether the patients have high blood pressure or not. 0 indicates the patient has no hypertension, and 1 indicates the patient has hypertension.
Heart Disease: It represents whether the patient has heart disease or not. 0 indicates the patient with no heart disease, and 1 indicates the patient with heart disease.
Ever married: It describes the marital status of a patient. Yes, indicates the patient is married, and no indicates that the patient is not married.
Residence Type: It indicates whether the patient belongs to rural or urban areas.
Average Glucose Level: This is the blood glucose level of the patient. High glucose levels cause stroke.
BMI: the body mass index of a patient. 
Smoking Status: The feature which has three sections, records the smoker’s status: smoked, never smoked, and formerly smoked.
Stroke: 0 indicates the patient with no stroke and with good health condition. 1 indicates that the patient is suffering from a stroke. 
Objectives:
•	Determining the relationship between factors such as target variable stroke, age, gender, BMI, marital status, heart disease, and hypertension.
•	Determining the best model to predict the stroke.
